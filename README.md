The westlake project is a front-end portal project developed using the vue3 composite API and vite

Only the src folder part of the front-end code is shown here

In addition to the basic page effect, this project also provides a simple ai dialogue page and comment area, lottery and other functions, but some functions are incomplete, welcome advice
